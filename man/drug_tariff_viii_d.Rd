\description{
Part VIIID of the Drug Tariff, lists the basic prices of certain specials and
imported unlicensed medicines to be paid relative to a commonly identified pack size.
}
\details{
The \href{https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff}{Drug Tariff}
is produced monthly by NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) on behalf of
the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and outlines "what will be
paid to pharmacy contractors for NHS services provided either for reimbursement
or for remuneration, rules to follow when dispensing, value of the fees and
allowances they will be paid and drug and appliance prices they will be paid".

The Drug Tariff uses the following definitions:
\itemize{
\item "Specials are unlicensed medicinal products manufactured in the UK for human
use which have been specially prepared to meet a prescription ordered for
individual patients without the need for the manufacturer to hold a
marketing authorisation for the medicinal product concerned.
\item Imported products are unlicensed medicinal products sourced from outside
the UK under an importers licence issued by the MHRA. These products have
been specially sourced to meet a prescription ordered for individual
patients without the need for the importer to hold a marketing authorisation
for the medicinal product concerned."
