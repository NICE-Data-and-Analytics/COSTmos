\description{
This dataset provides unit costs for practice nurses in the UK. These are
informed by the \href{https://research.kent.ac.uk/corec/unit-costs-2022-2027/}{Unit Costs of Health and Social Care Manual}
published by the Care and Outcomes Research Centre (COReC), which is designed to
support healthcare economic evaluations in the UK.
}
\details{
The table includes general practice nurse costs across years and different activity measures,
inclusive or exclusive of qualification costs and the ratio of direct to indirect time.

Note, only the cost per working hour excluding the ratio of direct to indirect
time is from the selected Unit Costs report. All other values are calculated
using that figure and:
\itemize{
\item The duration of contact per surgery consultation (15.5 mins) from the 2015
Unit Costs report [\href{https://kar.kent.ac.uk/60240/}{1}]
\item The average duration of nurse face-to-face (10 mins) and telephone (6 mins)
consultations from Stevens et al. (2017) [\href{https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018261}{2}]
}

Including the ratio of direct to indirect time on face-to-face contacts
factors in the 1:0.30 value for practice nurses from the 2015 Unit Costs report,
which suggests that each hour spent with a patient requires 1.3 paid hours.
