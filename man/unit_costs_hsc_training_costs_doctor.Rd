\description{
This dataset provides estimates of the training and qualification costs for
doctors in the UK. These are informed by the
\href{https://research.kent.ac.uk/corec/unit-costs-2022-2027/}{Unit Costs of Health and Social Care Manual}
published by the Care and Outcomes Research Centre (COReC),
which is designed to support economic evaluation in the UK.
}
\details{
The table includes the cost of qualification disaggregated into different items,
such as tuition fees, living expenses and loss production costs. It also
reports the expected annual cost discounted at 3.5\%, which allows use of
these estimates in NICE economic evaluations.
