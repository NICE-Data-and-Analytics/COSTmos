\details{
The \href{https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff}{Drug Tariff}
is produced monthly by NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) on behalf of
the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and outlines "what will be
paid to pharmacy contractors for NHS services provided either for reimbursement
or for remuneration, rules to follow when dispensing, value of the fees and
allowances they will be paid and drug and appliance prices they will be paid" [\href{https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff}{1}].

Drugs in Part VIIIA fall into three categories [\href{https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff}{1}, \href{https://cpe.org.uk/dispensing-and-supply/dispensing-process/drug-tariff-resources/virtual-drug-tariff/}{2}]:
\itemize{
\item Category A, readily available generics. The DHSC
calculates the reimbursement price based on information submitted by
manufacturers. All available pack sizes are considered.
\item Category C items are not readily available as a generic and the price is
based on a particular brand or manufacturer.
\item Category M, readily available generics. The DHSC calculates the
reimbursement price based on information submitted by manufacturers. Only
certain pack sizes are considered. Prices are adjusted quarterly to ensure
delivery of the "\href{https://cpe.org.uk/funding-and-reimbursement/pharmacy-funding/funding-distribution/retained-margin-category-m/}{retained buying margin}
(i.e. the profit pharmacies can earn on dispensing drugs through cost
effective purchasing)" agreed as part of the Community Pharmacy Contractual
Framework.
