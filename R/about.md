## Data sets  

### Drug Tariff  

The [Drug Tariff](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff) is produced monthly by NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) for the Department of Health and Social Care. It "outlines what will be paid to pharmacy contractors for NHS services (reimbursement or remuneration), rules to follow when dispensing, value of the fees and allowances you will be paid, drug and appliance prices you will be paid".
