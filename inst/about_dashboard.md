## Data sets

### Drug Tariff

The [Drug
Tariff](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff)
is produced monthly by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) for
the Department of Health and Social Care. It “outlines what will be paid
to pharmacy contractors for NHS services (reimbursement or
remuneration), rules to follow when dispensing, value of the fees and
allowances you will be paid, drug and appliance prices you will be
paid”.

COSTmos sources the following sections of the Drug Tariff from the web
pages below:

### Prescription Cost Analysis

The [Prescription Cost
Analysis](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/prescription-cost-analysis-england)
(PCA) is produced by the NHSBSA and “provides details of the number of
items and the Net Ingredient Cost (NIC) of all prescriptions dispensed
in the community in England”.

### National Cost Collection

The [National Cost
Collection](https://www.england.nhs.uk/costing-in-the-nhs/national-cost-collection/)
reports the national average unit cost and total cost for defined
services provided to NHS patients across NHS providers, per financial
year.

### Unit Costs of Health and Social Care

The [Unit Costs of Health and Social Care
manual](https://research.kent.ac.uk/corec/unit-costs-2022-2027/) is
published annually and estimates the unit cost of the delivery of health
and social care services. COSTmos only extracts the estimates for costs
per working hour and training costs for various healthcare
professionals. The manual is produced by the Care and Outcomes Research
Centre (COReC; formerly known as the Personal Social Services Research
Unit, PSSRU) at the University of Kent and the Centre for Health
Economics (CHE) at the University of York.
